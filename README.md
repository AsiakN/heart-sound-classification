# heart-sound-classification
This repo and the scripts in it demonstrates the complete workflow for developing an embedded machine learning application,including, extracting features,and tuning to get a model with good performance, and  deploying the model in a desktop application. Specifically, we develop a classifier of heart sounds into 'Normal' and 'Abnormal', which could be used in the medical practice to monitor patients who are at increased risk of dangerous heart conditions, and remove the need to have a skilled clincian present. 
The figure below shows the high-level architecture and a screenshot from the prototype.
